# IS452SP18-Final Megan Williams
Final project for my IS452 class

There are three Python files and three text files. the final versions start with a number 
1-Start author string.txt 
1-Adding Nominees.py
2-appended author string.txt
2-survey_choose_5.py
3-narrowed list.txt
3-ranking authors.py

I had to go back and rename everything so that it made sense to an outside, but still left my other files on Github.

1-Start author string.txt 
-Start here just to inspect the list of names. Nothing will happen to it but it is a good place to see where we are starting at

1-Adding Nominees.py
-next open this file and run it. The script will ask how many names you need to enter. It will prompt you that number of times to enter it in a specific format.

2-appended author string.txt
- Then inspect this file. It should have the sames names as the first text file and all the names that you entered in a string.

2-survey_choose_5.py
- open this file and run it. It print all the names from the last text file and ask you to type in five names to move to the next round. This will keep adding to the list each time you run it. 

3-narrowed list.txt
-open this and inspect it. The names you entered in the last script will all appear here and be used in the final Python file

3-ranking authors.py
-Run this. It will take the last text file, turn it into a list that has no duplicates. You'll be asked how many committee members you have. I recommend a smaller number or you'll be entering data all night. The script will ask you to rate all the authors from the narrowed list on grammar and prose. The script will do its thing and in converting it into a dictionary it will tell you the author with the top grammar score, top prose score and top overall score.
